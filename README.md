This project focuses on unit testing. There are 2 files - test_matrix_multiplier.py where the test cases are defined and\
matrix_multiplier.py where the actual matrix multiplication code is written, along with the various checks and error handling.

The project uses pytest to ensure that the test cases pass and flake8 for linting. Logging is used to trace the path taken by the code,\
which is used for debugging purpose, if needed. cProfile and tracemalloc is included in test_matrix_multiplier.py to capture the CPU and memory profile.
